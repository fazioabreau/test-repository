	<p><em>Yoga Mahila where balance unites mind, body and spirit.</em></p>
	<p>The practice of Yoga has existed for a really, really, really long time.<br>
     Some say, 10,000 years, but they weren't around then, so who really knows. <br>
      However, what we do know according to two of the most notable<br>
       Yoga gurus of OUR time is:<br>

<p>Yoga is the uniting of mind, body and spirit,<br>
through the practice of physical postures (asanas)<br>
 combined with disciplined breathing patterns (pranayama)<br>
drawing the practitioner into a state of wellness and bliss.

B.K.S. Iyengar,<br>
 is most notably known for alignment and therapy.<br>

K. Pattabhi Jois is most notably known for posture and breath control.

<p>When we think of life — we sometimes think after a certain age<br>
   it all stops and now what?<br>
  Think about the times you have decided not to begin something new, <br>
  maybe it's a new career, returning to school, a new hobby, etc . . . <br>
  Why? Because we live in an ageist society drilling in our brain “you’re too old.” <br>
I'm here to tell you it's not so; in watching  Tao Porchon-Lynch <br>
 I’ve learned that life  begins when you believe in yourself and <br>
 realize you CAN do anything at any age.  <br>
 Tao has shown us to be positive, because what you think occurs.<br>
When Tao had hip and wrist surgery she was told by doctors<br>
she wouldn’t be able to do advanced Yoga again,<br>
 to which she replied, “I’m not interested in what I can’t do only in what I can.”<br>
Now that's a way to approach life.</p>
